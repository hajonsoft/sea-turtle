          Palm Beach Zoo And Gumbo Limbo Nature Center Performed Laser Surgery
          On Several Endangered Green Sea Turtles To Remove Fibropapilloma
          Tumors On The Turtles’ Eyes And Flippers. Fibropapillomatosis (FP) Is
          Likely Caused By A Virus. The Tumors Are Not Cancerous But Impair The
          Vision And Mobility Of The Sea Turtles And The Tumors May Become
          Infected Creating Secondary Health Risks. In Florida, The Disease Has
          Reached Epidemic Proportions. Although It Is Not Thought To Be
          Directly Caused By Pollution, Poor Water Quality In Florida’s Inner
          Waterways Is Likely To Be A Driving Factor For The Disease Outbreak.
          The Only Treatment For The Disease Is To Remove Them With A Laser. Dr.
          Kirt Rusenko, Gumbo Limbo’s Marine Conservationist Says, “Juvenile
          Green Sea Turtles Forage In The Intracoastal Lagoons And Other
          Waterways. These Waterways Are Highly Polluted From Agricultural
          Run-Off, Residential Pesticides, And From Storm Sewers Draining
          Directly Into The Waterways. We See About A 4% Infection Rate Of
          Turtles In The Ocean Compared To 60-70% Infection Rate In Turtles
          Pulled From The Inner Water Ways.”

          Multiple Factors Including Stress From Pollution, Changes In Sea
          Turtles’ Diet Due To A Strained Environment, And Compromised Immune
          Systems May All Play A Part In Green Sea Turtles Susceptibility To The
          Disease. Gumbo Limbo Nature Center Is Only One Of Four Sea Turtle
          Rehabilitation Facilities In Florida That Treats Turtles With FP.
          Gumbo Limbo Manager, Stefanie Ouellette, Says, “Treating Sea Turtles
          With FP Not Only Directly Helps With Sea Turtle Conservation But Is An
          Opportunity To Educate The Public About The Broader Issues Affecting
          Our Marine And Coastal Environments. Sea Turtles Are One Of Many
          Species Of Plants And Animals Affected By Pollution In Our Inner
          Coastal Waterways.” Gumbo Limbo Nature Center Formed A Partnership
          With The Palm Beach Zoo’s Center For Conservation Medicine At The
          Melvin J. And Claire Levine Animal Complex When It Opened Its Sea
          Turtle Rehabilitation Facility In January Of 2010. The Partnership Was
          Made To Share Resources And Advance The Emerging Field Of Conservation
          Medicine. The State-Of-The-Art Laser Being Used By Gumbo Limbo’s
          Veterinarian, Dr. Nancy Mettee, Was Recently Donated To Friends Of
          Gumbo Limbo By The National Save The Sea Turtle Foundation Through A
          Gift In Memory Of Suzanne Kemp To Support The Partnership Between
          Gumbo Limbo And The Zoo. The Laser Is Not Only Precise But Powerful
          Enough To Operate On Much Larger Animals. Friends Of Gumbo Limbo
          Development Officer, Mike Zewe Said, “The Palm Beach Zoo And The
          National Save The Sea Turtle Foundation Have Been Critical Partners In
          Making Our Sea Turtle Rehabilitation Facility A Great Success. The Zoo
          Offers A Place To Perform Surgeries And Provides Additional Equipment
          Such As An X-Ray Machine, While The National Save The Sea Turtle
          Foundation Continues To Financially Back The Program. To Date, We Have
          Already Treated More Than 200 Endangered Sea Turtles And Have Had More
          Than 100,000 Visitors To The Center Since Its Opening.
