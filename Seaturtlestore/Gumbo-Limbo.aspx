          ><em>The National Save the Sea Turtle Foundation</em> presented Gumbo
          Limbo Nature Center, Inc., with a $25,000 check to support its new Sea
          Turtle Rehabilitation Program.<br /><br /> “We are happy to begin a
          relationship with
          <em>The National Save the Sea Turtle Foundation</em>. Their donation
          has helped us to surpass our fund raising goal for the initiation of
          our sea turtle rehabilitation program, and we look forward to a
          partnership on future projects,” said Mike Zewe, Development Officer
          for Gumbo Limbo Nature Center, Inc.<br /><br /> In addition to the
          check presentation and ribbon cutting ceremony for the rehabilitation
          program, the Greater Boca Raton Beach and Parks District will honor
          Gumbo Limbo founder, Gordon Gilbert with a commemorative plaque which
          will be unveiled and permanently placed at Gumbo Limbo.<br /><br />
          “The rehabilitation program will not only help sick and injured
          turtles but will raise public awareness of the threats these animals
          face. The program will add another layer to the City’s sea turtle
          research and conservation program which will greatly enhance our
          conservation efforts, “ said Dr. Kirt Rusenko, Boca Raton Marine
          Conservationist.<br /><br />
          Gumbo Limbo Nature Center is currently celebrating 25 years of coastal
          and marine education, preservation, conservation and research. The
          center is a collaborative project between the city of Boca Raton, the
          Greater Boca Raton Beach and Park District, the School District of
          Palm Beach Country, Florida Atlantic University, and Gumbo Limbo
          Nature Center, Inc., a 501 (c) (3) organization.
