        This exhibit extends our educational reach at IGFA museum, where we
        sponsor sea turtle protection seminars for the Boy Scouts and Girl
        Scouts of America. We hope the exhibit will raise concern in all who
        visit the museum for the sea turtle and its plight. It's through the
        cooperative efforts of organizations such as the IGFA that we may gain
        the momentum in the struggle to get the sea turtle removed from the
        endangered species list.
